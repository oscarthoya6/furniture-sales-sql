reduced purchasing frequency.
### Project 7: Marketing Campaign ROI Analysis

4. Analyze sales trends before and after each marketing campaign to evaluate its impact.
5. Create a segmentation analysis to understand which customer groups responded best to each
campaign.
### Project 8: Predictive Sales Analytics
Objective: Use historical sales data to forecast future sales and trends.

on past trends.
4. Create a forecasting report that breaks down future sales expectations by region and market
segment.
